Q(house): How many people are in your household?
X:number
	Q(income): Including any and all Public Benefits, how much income does your household bring in per year in after tax dollars?
	X[javascript:if (fedpov(getvar('house'),getvar('income'),133)){ goto('indigent') } else { goto('noqual') } ]:number
Q(indigent): You probably qualify as indigent since you earn less than 133% of the poverty line. 

Q(noqual): You likely will not qualify as indigent because your household income is above 133% of the poverty line.
